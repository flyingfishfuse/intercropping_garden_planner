# intercropping_garden_planner
tool for planning a garden with intercropping using a grid system

the idea is you put in the plants you either have planted  already to find good 
neighbors or you make the shape of your plot and have it auto fill in the rest 
after you put preferred plants in preferred locations. OR BOTH!

Database works

Working on getting the grid to pop up ... no errors but it's not working!!! ARRRGGGHHH!

Once the window draws and the code is tied together, I will package it up for everyone to use
on any computer

 - Will include position of sun at "x" time of day / angle of light / shadow
 - Companion "groups" , E.g. Three/Four Sisters, Per Cell
 - other stuff I guess. I am trying to grow food here lol.
