# intercropping_garden_planner
tool for planning a garden with intercropping using a grid system
the idea is you put in the plants you either have planted already to find good neighbors or you make the shape of your plot 
and have it auto fill in the rest after you put preferred plants in preferred locations.
Database works

wikipedia table lookup to database works

Grid SHOULD work, about to start working on that. 

Once the window draws and the code is tied together, I will implement more advanced stuff

 - Will include position of sun at "x" time of day / angle of light / shadow
 - Companion "groups" , E.g. Three/Four Sisters, Per Cell
 - other stuff I guess. I am trying to grow food here lol.
