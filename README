# intercropping_garden_planner
tool for planning a garden with intercropping using a grid system

Database works
wikipedia table lookup to database works
Grid SHOULD work, about to start working on that. 
Once the window draws and the code is tied together, I will implement more advanced stuff

 - Will include position of sun at "x" time of day / angle of light / shadow
 - Companion "groups" , E.g. Three/Four Sisters, Per Cell
 - other stuff I guess. I am trying to grow food here lol.
